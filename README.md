# Portfolio - Slack Clone

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It can be run locally with `yarn start`

The idea was to create a new portfolio website by mimicking Slack's UI and presenting all info as Slack messages in the different channels.
